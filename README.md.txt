## Design Choices

* Component-based SCSS: The SCSS is divided into components, making the codebase more modular and easier to manage. Each component handles a specific part of the UI.
* Images from Pexels: All images are sourced from Pexels. These images are used with the understanding that my previous company is okay with keeping them on the site.
